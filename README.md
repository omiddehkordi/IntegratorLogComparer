Once you compile the code


1) Drag the file onto your Desktop


2) Open your Terminal and change the directory to the Folder Name (use the command cd PATHNAME; e.g. cd /Users/omid/Desktop/logcompare)


3) use the command ./compare PATH1 PATH2 (e.g. ./compare /Users/omid/Desktop/log1.log  /Users/omid/Desktop/log2.log)


4) The program will then produce an output file in the same folder as the program that has the difference between measurements and tolerances printed with the corresponding component name



Let me know if there are any issues.
